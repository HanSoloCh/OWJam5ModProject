    "Ha! I'm sorry if I frightened you.": "哈！不好意思吓到你了。",
    "I wondered why this old project was claiming to have been submitted again after all these years! I'm Adonsonia, one of the students who worked on this project a long time ago.": 
    "我还在想这个老旧的项目为什么这么多年后又显示已被提交！我是阿冬索尼娅，很久以前参与这个项目的学生之一。",
    "You don't look like a Nomai, but you must be quite clever to have gotten this system into the correct configuration after all of the time it has spent drifting.": 
    "你看上去不像挪麦人，但你一定很聪明，能将这个漂泊许久的星系再一次设定为正确的状态。",
    "Effort like that is certainly worthy of some reward. How about this; I have some free time from all of my teaching duties right now! If you ask me any questions, I'll do my best to answer them.": 
    "这种努力当然值得回报。这样如何：我现在有些空闲时间，不必忙于教学任务！你可以问我任何问题，我会尽我所能给你答复。",

    "I don't have any more questions for now.": "我目前没有其他问题了。",
    "That would be due to the universal translator I have on my person. It's able to quickly discern language patterns, allowing us to understand each other with minimal issues. We have Betula to thank for that — it's actually her invention!": 
    "这归功于我随身携带的通用翻译器。它能迅速识别语言模式，使我们以极少的障碍相互理解。我们应该感谢贝秋拉——这其实是她的发明！",
    "Ah, that fascicle of nerves. Although his anxiety is still there, he's become much better at managing it. He's also grown more able to take a joke, much to my relief.": 
    "啊，那个总是紧张兮兮的人。尽管他的焦虑还在，但他已经善于应对它了。他也变得更开得起玩笑了，这让我松了口气。",
    "As you might imagine, he had a very good academic career after our project. After completing his education he moved on to become one of our clan's head researchers. He's used his knowledge of star systems particularly well, helping our clan identify systems likely to harbor life.": 
    "想必你也料到，他在我们的项目结束后科研事业节节攀升。完成学业后，他成为了我们家族最顶尖的研究员之一。他尤其擅长利用自己对于恒星系的充分认识，帮助我们家族识别可能存在生命的星系。",
    "Through his efforts our clan has met friends of many different forms, and had quite the cultural exchange. This was quite useful in the development of the universal translator I'm using to speak to you now.": 
    "通过他的努力，我们家族结识了许多不同形态的朋友，进行了丰富多彩的文化交流。这极大地推动了我正在用于与你对话的通用翻译器的开发进程。",
    "I believe he's currently using his skills to identify stars that are still stable enough to support our people, as well as others. He's also made himself useful to rescue efforts, identifying star systems simultaneously likely to have life and likely to be annihilated soon.": 
    "他目前应该正在利用自己的专业技能，识别那些足够稳定的恒星，用于支持我们的族人以及其他物种。他还在救援工作中发挥作用，识别那些可能存在生命且可能很快湮灭的星系。",
    "Betula actually went on to study alien cultures and languages. She was always more interested in social affairs than strictly academic ones, so it was a type of work that uniquely suited her.": 
    "贝秋拉后来去研究外星文化和语言了。相比纯粹的学术研究，她总是更喜欢参与社会事务，因此这类工作简直为她量身定制。",
    "She has been the first Nomai to contact a number of different alien species, and used the knowledge gained to develop the universal translator that allows us to communicate now.": 
    "她是第一个与许多外星物种建立联系的挪麦人，利用获取的知识开发了这款我们正在用于交流的通用翻译器。",
    "She's even caused some members of other species to join Nomai clans. Due to her efforts, approximately half of our clan is actually composed of non-Nomai species. Their insights have led to some remarkable technological breakthroughs.": 
    "她甚至还让一些其他物种的成员加入了挪麦家族。由于她的努力，我们家族大约有一半的成员是由非挪麦物种构成的。他们的知识为我们带来了一些令人瞩目的科技突破。",
    "Nowadays she uses her social skills to help people of varying cultures cooperate, which is especially important given the dwindling resources of our universe. It's a bit of a shame, I imagine she would have been quite thrilled to speak with you if she were here.": 
    "如今她正在利用自己的社交技能帮助不同文化的人们相互协作，考虑到我们的宇宙中所剩无几的资源，这项工作尤其重要。真是遗憾，我想假如她在这里，一定会非常高兴与你对话。",
    "Ha! Daucus always says he was never able to beat that lazy streak of his, although I'm honestly not convinced that he ever tried. The only thing he was ever willing to put real effort into was hacking systems.": 
    "哈！道库斯总说自己没法克服懒散的毛病，但我实在没法相信他努力过。他唯一愿意真正投入精力的事情就是破解系统。",
    "Fortunately, he was able to use that to find his place refurbishing and repurposing old technology. He's been able to revive a number of machines that, by all accounts, never should have been able to work again.": 
    "幸运的是，他利用这点找到了自己的定位，专门从事老旧科技设备的翻新和再利用。他成功修复了许多按理来说再也无法运行的机器。",
    "He's actually expanded the number of ships available to our people quite substantially. This has allowed our clan to contact many more species than would otherwise be possible. I believe that other clans even bring him derelict vessels from time to time in the hopes that he can repair them.": 
    "事实上，他极大程度地增加了我们族人能使用的飞船数量。这让我们家族能够与更多的物种取得联系，这原本是非常难以实现的。其他家族甚至时不时为他带来废弃的飞船，希望他能进行修理。",
    "I'm unsure how he feels about it, but he's recently been put in charge of a substantially sized team. With the current state of the universe, it's more important than ever to keep equipment operational for as long as possible. He's actually become quite an important member of our clan.": 
    "我不确定他对此作何感想，但他最近被任命领导一个规模相当可观的团队。在当前的宇宙状态下，让仪器设备尽可能长时间维持运转具有前所未有的重要性。他实际上已经成为了我们家族非常重要的一员。",
    "As you may have guessed, I never took my studies particularly seriously as a child. In school, I was much more concerned with playing pranks on Alnus and socializing with Betula.": 
    "想必你也猜到了，我小时候从未认真对待过自己的学业。在学校里，我更热衷于捉弄奥努斯，或与贝秋拉闲聊。",
    "It was actually the influence of our old teacher, Oryza, that led to me becoming a teacher. She was able to convince me to put more effort into my studies, something that I am now very thankful for whenever a student comes to me with questions.": 
    "事实上，是我们以前的老师欧瑞扎激励我成为了一名教师。她成功说服了我更加努力学习，现在每当有学生来向我请教问题时，我都对此十分感激。",
    "Outside of standard teaching duties, I've also been aiding in communications between us Nomai and other species. Some other teachers and I have even created an inter-species teacher association to aid in the spread of different people's knowledge.": 
    "在常规的教学任务之外，我也一直致力于促进挪麦人与其他物种的沟通交流。我和其他一些老师甚至创建了一个跨物种教师协会，从而促进不同种族知识的传播。",
    "Lately things have been a bit more difficult, what with the universe coming to an end and all. The students are actually doing fairly well emotionally speaking, but you would not believe the number of them who try to make existential arguments for missing assignments!": 
    "近期事情变得有些棘手，毕竟宇宙即将走向终结了。学生们的情绪都还稳定，但你不会想到有多少学生对缺交作业进行存在主义的辩解！",
    "Device... Ah, that old thing! That's an old prototype for the orrery used in our project. We found it lying around at some point during our work, and decided to see if we could get into some mischief with it.": 
    "设备……啊，那个旧东西！那是我们项目中天体仪的原型机。我们在工作时发现它被闲置在某个地方，于是决定试着用它玩点小把戏。",
    "Daucus was able to hack it to become responsive if certain conditions were met, so that we could use it without the adults becoming aware of its functional state.": 
    "道库斯成功破解了它，使它在特定条件满足时响应，这样我们就可以暗中使用它，而不让大人们察觉它还能正常运转。",
    "...Unfortunately, it proved to be highly unstable and dangerous. I really shouldn't tell you how to activate it. I have learned some responsibility over the years, after all.": 
    "……不幸的是，它被证明非常不稳定和危险。我真的不能告诉你如何激活它。毕竟这么多年，我也学会了一些责任感。",
    "...Oh, alright, but don't claim that I didn't warn you. You should exercise extreme caution around that device — it's quite possible for it to <![CDATA[<color=red>break things</color>]]> and not function entirely as expected.": 
    "……噢，好吧，但别声称我没警告过你。在装置周围必须采取极端防护措施——它很可能<![CDATA[<color=red>造成破坏</color>]]>，无法完全按照预期运行。",
    "To activate it, all of the orbs on the invitation platform need to be placed at roughly the same distance from the center. Additionally, it won't activate unless it is approached by somebody who is not wearing any space gear.": 
    "激活邀请平台需要将它上面的所有圆球放置在与中心距离大致相同的位置。除此之外，未穿着任何太空装备的人靠近后，它才会被启动。",
    "As for what exactly it does... I suppose I'll leave you to figure that out for yourself! Have fun, and be careful!": 
    "至于它具体是做什么的……我想我就留给你自己去发现吧！玩得开心，注意安全！",
    "Understood. I'll be here for some time, so feel free to come back if you change your mind.": "好的。我还会在这里待一段时间，如果你改变想法，欢迎随时过来。",

    //convergence_explanation
    "BETULA: This structure is <![CDATA[<i>very</i>]]> impressive, although I don't recall us ever discussing it or its construction.": 
    "贝秋拉：这个装置令人印象<![CDATA[<i>非常</i>]]>深刻，不过我不记得我们曾经讨论过它或它的建造事宜。",
    "ADONSONIA: This is just a small puzzle that I made in my spare time. It uses those old radios that Oryza gave us for detecting signals. If anyone manages to solve it, the computer over there will activate and display its information.": 
    "阿冬索尼娅：这只是我利用空闲时间做的一个小谜题。它使用欧瑞扎给我们的老旧收音机来探测信号。如果有人成功解出，那里的电脑就会启动并显示信息。",

    //geyser_hint
    "BETULA: With access to the planet's true surface, I noticed some interesting looking geysers located near the north pole.": 
    "贝秋拉：抵达星球真正的表面后，我在北极附近发现了一些奇特的喷泉。",

    "贝秋拉：我们老师提到过它们。据说这些喷泉一直通往星球内部的空洞核心。她说那底下有什么东西，想让我们去看看。",

    "奥努斯：我想警告大家，据我们老师所说，这个山洞里充斥着一种高度危险的隐形物质。请注意规避！",
    "ALNUS: Fortunately, it seems that the substance can be temporarily neutralized with water. If anyone accidentally touches it, we can use that to our advantage.":

    //missing_transmitter_hint
    "BETULA: Oryza said that each planet would have a warp transmitter on its north pole that leads to the orrery station, but I don't see one here.": 
    "贝秋拉：欧瑞扎说每个星球的北极都有一个通往天体仪空间站的跃迁发射点，但我在这里没看到。",
    "ALNUS: I suppose she only said that <![CDATA[<i>most</i>]]> of the transmitters would be on the north pole. Perhaps this one is somewhere else.": 
    "奥努斯：我想她只说了<![CDATA[<i>大部分</i>]]>发射点位于北极。也许这个发射点在其他位置。",
    "DAUCUS: That's irritating. Lack of access to this planet's transmitter will make travel much more difficult.": "道库斯：真是麻烦。无法使用这颗星球的发射点会让交通变得非常困难。",

    "ADONSONIA: I'm really sorry everyone, but I may have accidentally dropped the materials for the other transmitter into the star during transport.": 
    "阿冬索尼娅：非常抱歉大家，我可能不小心在运输过程中将建造另一个发射点的材料掉进了恒星里。",
    "ALNUS: Adonsonia! That was our last warp core! I don't know why you feel the need to constantly sabotage us! Do you just dislike us all?": 
    "奥努斯：阿冬索尼娅！那是我们最后的跃迁核心了！我不知道你为什么总要搞破坏！你就这么讨厌我们吗？",
    "ADONSONIA: I didn't mean to drop it, it just happened! I know I do more pranks than you would like, but I'd never purposefully cause actual harm to the project!": 
    "阿冬索尼娅：我不是故意弄丢材料的，只是不小心的！我知道我做了太多恶作剧，但我从未故意对项目造成破坏！",
    "ALNUS: Even if we choose to believe you, that doesn't change the fact that we're now out of warp cores. Without another one we can't make any more transmitters, which means we can only use one of the receivers.": 
    "奥努斯：即使我们选择相信你，也不能改变我们用尽了跃迁核心的事实。没有核心就无法制造更多发射点，我们就只能使用其中一个接收点。",
    "DAUCUS: Don't worry about that. I've gone ahead and hacked the transmitter to work with either receiver, depending on which one lines up. That way, we won't need a second transmitter.": 
    "道库斯：这个不用担心。我已经提前破解了发射点，让它能与任意对齐的接收点配对。这样我们就不需要第二个发射点了。",
    "ADONSONIA: Thank you, Daucus! I am really sorry about incinerating those components, but I'm glad you were able to clean up my mess a bit.": 
    "阿冬索尼娅：谢谢你，道库斯！我真的很抱歉焚毁了那些部件，但还好你能帮我收拾一些残局。",
    "BETULA: We know, Adonsonia. Alnus is just upset. Everyone makes mistakes.": "贝秋拉：我们明白，阿冬索尼娅。奥努斯只是不太高兴。每个人都会犯错。",
    "ALNUS: Really? That's very helpful, Daucus! We were really relying on those warp pads, so it's good to have them all usable.": 
    "奥努斯：真的吗？这帮上大忙了，道库斯！我们真的很依赖这些跃迁点，能将它们全部投入使用是件好事。",

    "ADONSONIA: I wish I could achieve such a feat, but that wasn't me! I recall an old study on this kind of stone, which concluded that they move when unobserved.": 
    "阿冬索尼娅：但愿我能实现这样的壮举，但这不是我干的！我记得很久以前有一项关于这种石头的研究，结论是它们不被观察时会自行移动。",
    "BETULA: That is quite an interesting trait! Do you have any idea where it may go when it's not here?": "贝秋拉：这真是个奇妙的特点！你知道它不在这里时会去哪里吗？",
    "ADONSONIA: I'm not sure, to be honest. I don't believe I've seen it anywhere besides here.": "阿冬索尼娅：实话实说，我也不确定。除了这里之外，我没有在其他地方见过它。",
    "ALNUS: I would accuse you of lying if the stone hadn't appeared behind me moments ago (nearly scaring my lower garments off). Unfortunately, it took a recording of mine with it, and it doesn't seem to have brought it back.": 
    "奥努斯：要不是刚才石头在我背后出现了（差点把我下半身的衣物吓掉），我会指责你在说谎。不幸的是，它之前带走了一份我的录音，但似乎没有将它带回来。",

    "DAUCUS: I must say, Adonsonia, it is impressively lazy that you spent all this time at this structure and have only built this little platform.": 
    "道库斯：我必须得说，阿冬索尼娅，你花了这么长时间在这个建筑上，竟然只建起了这个小平台，真是懒得令人佩服。",
    "ADONSONIA: There would be more here, but it seems that somebody has covered the building I've labored for hours on almost entirely in sand!": 
    "阿冬索尼娅：这里本来应该还有别的东西，但看上去有人把我花费好几小时幸苦建造的建筑整个埋在了沙子里！",
    "BETULA: I apologize — I believe that may be my fault. I wanted us to have a planet approximating a desert, so I placed a large amount of sand on this one without realizing there was a structure already built.": 
    "贝秋拉：我向你道歉——我认为这应该是我的错。我想让我们有一颗类似沙漠的星球，因此在这颗星球上放了大量的沙子，却不知道这里有一座已经造好的建筑。",
    "ADONSONIA: I suppose this is more karma for my own antics than anything else, so I accept your apology. I would appreciate help figuring out a way to get rid of the sand, though. I wonder if there may be some way to move it somewhere else.": 
    "阿冬索尼娅：我想这不如说是我自己胡闹的报应，所以我接受你的道歉。不过如果有人能帮我想办法摆脱这些沙子，我将不胜感激。不知道有没有办法把沙子移到其他地方。",
    "ALNUS: That is so strange, Adonsonia! It's almost as if people interfering with your work isn't terribly fun.": "奥努斯：这真是奇怪，阿冬索尼娅！就好像有人干扰你的工作并不有趣一样。",

    //teleporter_nodoor_hint
    "ALNUS: Who constructed this building around the warp receiver? I know we wanted one, but I can't seem to locate the door.": 
    "奥努斯：谁在跃迁接收器周围建造了这个建筑？我知道我们计划造一座建筑，但我似乎找不到门。",
    "ADONSONIA: Would you look at that? It seems that I <![CDATA[<i>unintentionally forgot</i>]]> to put a door on the building. <![CDATA[<i>100% accidental</i>]]>, I can assure you.": 
    "阿冬索尼娅：这可真是！看来我似乎<![CDATA[<i>不小心忘记了</i>]]>给这座建筑造一扇门。<![CDATA[<i>百分之百的意外</i>]]>，我向你保证。",
